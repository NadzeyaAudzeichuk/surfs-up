# Surfs-Up
Weather analysis using SQLite, SQLAlchemy

# Overview

This project aims to analyze the weather dataset to determine if Surf n'Shake (a shop serving surfboards and ice cream) business is sustainable year-round. The focus will be on precipitations and temperatures for June and December. We will run an analysis in Jupyter Notebook. To connect the Oahu weather dataset (stored in SQLite database), we will use the SQLAlchemy library (to facilitate the communication between Python and the database).
